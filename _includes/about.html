              <br/>
                <p> Osiyo! My name is Anna Quinlan and I'm a rising sophomore at Stanford University studying computer science on the biocomputation track. I'm fascinated by new uses of technology to solve problems in healthcare and research, creating new tools to help patients manage their health. I'm passionate about increasing indigenous representation in STEM fields, and am currently the webmaster for Stanford's chapter of the American Indian Science and Engineering Society. Outside of school, you'll find me baking homemade sourdough bread, running marathons and half marathons, re-reading my favorite books, and backpacking.
