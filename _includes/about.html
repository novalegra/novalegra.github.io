              <br/>
                <p> Osiyo! I'm a rising sophomore at Stanford University studying computer science on the biocomputation track. I love creating tools to help patients manage their health, and am fascinated by new ways to use technology to solve problems in healthcare and research. I'm also passionate about increasing indigenous representation in STEM fields, and am currently the co-president of Stanford's chapter of the American Indian Science and Engineering Society. Outside of school, you'll find me backpacking, baking homemade sourdough bread, running marathons and half marathons, and re-reading my favorite books.
