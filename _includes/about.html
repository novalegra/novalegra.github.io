              <br/>
                <p> Osiyo! My name is Anna Quinlan and I'm currently a freshman at Stanford University studying computer science on the biocomputation track. I love how coding integrates (and helps to make sense of) the numerous aspects in the world we live in, especially with regard to big data. I'm passionate about increasing indigenous representation in STEM fields, and am currently the webmaster for Stanford's chapter of the American Indian Science and Engineering Society. Outside of school, you'll find me baking homemade sourdough bread, running marathons and half marathons, re-reading my favorite books, and backpacking.
