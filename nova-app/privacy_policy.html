                  Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are
                  commonly used as anonymous unique identifiers. These are sent
                  to your browser from the websites that you visit and are
                  stored on your device's internal memory. This Service does not use 
                  these “cookies” explicitly and I do not use any third-party code that
                  utilizes cookies.

                  I value your trust in providing your
                  Personal Information to Nova, and strive to use commercially
                  acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no method of electronic
                  storage, including HealthKit, is 100% secure and reliable, and I cannot
                  guarantee its absolute security.
