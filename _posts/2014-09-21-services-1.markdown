title: A Low Cost, Closed Loop Insulin Pump Powered by OpenAPS

  I created an insulin pump that costs much less than conventional pumps, at only $40, but has more features than current pumps on the market, such as predictive text notifications of blood sugar changes requiring user intervention. The pump runs a modified version of oref0, meaning it is able to both change basal insulin rates and issue super-microboluses in response to changes in blood glucose levels.
