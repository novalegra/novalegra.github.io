 I created a Java program to automate student seating at my 2400-student high schoolâ€™s graduation, since students are handed their diploma by a faculty member of their choice. It takes a .csv data file, then groups students by teacher (sorting students alphabetically within the group), seats graduation speakers and musicians in the front, forms rows of appropriate width to create a triangular arrangement with a user-input starting value and step value, and returns a new .csv file with the seating arrangement.
