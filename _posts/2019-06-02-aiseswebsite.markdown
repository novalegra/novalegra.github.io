I served as webmaster for the Stanford American Indian Science and Engineering Society (AISES) for the 2019-20 school year, where I completely redid the website to improve the user interface and ease of maintenance. I also created a new website for the Stanford American Indian Organization (SAIO), and helped to maintain the Stanford Powwow website.
