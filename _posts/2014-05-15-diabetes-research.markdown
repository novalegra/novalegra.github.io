I work with Dr. Rayhan Lal at the Stanford School of Medicine on variety of diabetes technology research projects. I've created a first-in-class unsupervised learning algorithm to detect self-harm in patients with diabetes, investigated novel applications of insulin-curve modeling in automated insulin dosing systems, and generated new multi-factorial insulin pump settings equations based on observational data. During this research, I worked closely with members of the open-source diabetes community to translate our findings from the lab into software used by thousands of patients with diabetes.
