As a summer intern at Tidepool, I developed a Python-based implementation of the Loop automated insulin-dosing algorithm, then used the algorithm for issue report analysis and visualization. I collaborated across three different teams to ensure usability in a wide variety of use cases. This tool is currently being used by Tidepool to run simulations to generate data for the Loop FDA submission, and by university researchers to study the Loop algorithm.
