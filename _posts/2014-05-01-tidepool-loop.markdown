While working at Tidepool on the Loop development team, I created the therapy settings acceptance flow with SwiftUI to allow users to review their prescribed therapy settings and edit them if needed. The patient inputs their prescription information, then the flow fetches the settings from the Tidepool backend and presents them to the user, along with educational information. During my time on the team, I also developed comprehensive high-level tests for the Loop algorithm and created new SwiftUI components for the Tidepool Loop Watch app.
